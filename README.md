# Docs GitHub actions

https://github.com/Consensys/docs-gha acts as a single source of truth (sot) for actions that keep 
the docs sites shiny.

## Work in progress

### ES lint

ES lint ignores .md and .mdx. Need to test whether it can lint codeblocks within those files.

### Vale

[Vale](https://vale.sh/docs/) is currently [WIP for use locally and as GH action](spelling/README.md).
