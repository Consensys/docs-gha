# Docs GitHub actions

https://github.com/Consensys/docs-gha acts as a single source of truth (sot) for actions that keep the docs sites shiny.

## Work in progress

### Vale

Vale is currently wip. The Vale resources and project-word resources from several sites will
be compiled to this one sot.

#### Vale and Yaml?

If API specs are managed as YAML files, need to test whether Vale can handle linting YAMLs.

### ES lint

ES lint ignores .md and .mdx. Need to test whether it can lint codeblocks within those files.
